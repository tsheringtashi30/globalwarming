                    <h2>What is Global Warming?</h2>
                    <p>Global warming refers to the long-term rise in Earth's average surface temperature due to human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a warming effect known as the greenhouse effect.</p>
