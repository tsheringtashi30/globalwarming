                    <h2>Solutions to Combat Global Warming</h2>
                    <p>While the challenge is immense, there are several ways to mitigate global warming and reduce its effects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Transitioning to renewable sources of energy like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can significantly reduce carbon emissions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Improving energy efficiency in buildings, vehicles, and industries can reduce energy consumption and emissions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reforestation:</strong> Planting trees and restoring forests can help absorb CO2 and restore ecosystems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Carbon Pricing:</strong> Implementing carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems can incentivize industries to reduce their emissions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Individual Actions:</strong> Reducing waste, consuming less, using public transport, and adopting sustainable practices can make a difference.</li>
                    </ul>
